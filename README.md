The **Complex.SpecFlow.Assist** package provides support to feature flags, also including a way to auto-generate a class with properties corresponding to each feature.
It allows you to use dependency injection to register multiple providers for the flags.
That allows you inject that class in any point of the system that require the use of a flag using dependency injection.
It also allows to the compiler to validate the name of a flag giving errors in compile time if the flag is not valig.   

Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/AndreVianna/StronglyTyped.FeatureFlags/wiki/Documentation) for more information and samples.
